# basic-rust-test

This is a test Rust program I made to learn how Rust works while implementing a bunch of random things for fun.

## Commands

To run a command, type `basic-rust-test <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]`.

1. `current_time`: Prints the current time.
2. `rng_simple`: Prints the output of a given RNG with a given seed.
3. `sleep`: Sleeps for a given amount of time, then quits.

## Building

To build, make sure the Rust programming language is installed on your computer, then clone the repository and run `cargo run`. To run the tests, run `cargo test`.
