move main.rs stuff info subfolders
remove apparently unnecessary unwraps
convert compiled in hex calls to hex!
add state export functions to rngengine trait
convert panics into errors, even in main func (it manually sets a nonzero status code instead)
remove rust-crypto depenency, replace with sha3
add cgcsprng2, well512a and 3 others (using reference implementation and thus requiring adding of a legal section to this program), xorshift128+, xoroshiro256++
add null cache, byte cache, bit cache
add assembly trng rdrand rdseed (https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/intel-digital-random-number-generator-drng-software-implementation-guide.html, https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/inline-assembly.html)
move off main function prints to seperate module, then do the tests folder sorting:
  split main code into parser that produces an enum and runner that takes in the enum; parser code can then be tested; potentially can also test actual output of command by making output a string and then checking for equality
add resource allocate subcommand

low priority:
reconcile the 2 inexplicably different types in the current_time subcommand
improve argument handling of main.rs as seed isnt needed sometimes (make seed be nullable value and check for its existence when necessary)
make sleep function call Sleep(INFINITE) function on windows (https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs)
figure out how to move cgrandom into a library crate

keep in mind:
if other tests for cgrandom are added other than the generators, then move current cgrandom tests into generators subfolder
